            Raspberries are small, delicate berries known for their vibrant red
            color and sweet-tart flavor. They belong to the genus Rubus and are
            rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, particularly vitamin C
            and manganese. These nutrients contribute to their numerous health
            benefits, which include anti-inflammatory properties and potential
            cancer-fighting effects.

            In terms of culinary uses, raspberries are highly versatile. They
            can be enjoyed fresh, used in baked goods like cakes and muffins, or
            made into jams and jellies. Raspberries also add a delightful flavor
            to desserts such as mousses, tarts, and sorbets. Their bright color
            and distinct taste make them a popular ingredient in smoothies and
            cocktails as well. Here are my favorite recipes involving
            raspberries:

            Beyond their taste, raspberries are often used in health-focused
            recipes due to their high fiber content and beneficial plant
            compounds, making them a popular choice for those looking to add
            both flavor and nutrition to their meals.
