            Blueberries, small, round, and typically blue to purple in color,
            are renowned for their sweet and mildly tart flavor. These berries
            are highly nutritious, offering an abundance of antioxidants,
            particularly anthocyanins, which give them their distinctive color.
            They are also rich in vitamins C and K, and dietary fiber, and are
            known for their numerous health benefits, including improved heart
            health and brain function, and potential anti-diabetic effects.
